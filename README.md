## Library App

The Library App is a simple web application designed to help users search and explore a collection of books. Built with a React frontend and a Java backend, the app allows users to type in a search bar, and it dynamically filters and displays books whose titles match the search input. The search functionality is optimized with debouncing to reduce unnecessary API calls, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

The app also includes features like pagination to handle large datasets efficiently, displaying books in manageable chunks. Enhanced with clean and modern styling, the Library App provides an intuitive interface for users to browse and discover books seamlessly. Whether you're looking for a specific title or exploring new reads, this app makes it easy to find what you need.
